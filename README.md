# OpenGL-Abstractions
OpenGL Abstracted Classes to dive in and get coding. Not super flexible but these abstractions are good enough to start experimenting wtih any OpenGL code.

#### Check the [**tests**](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/OpenGL-Abstractions/tree/master/tests) folder to see various implementation such as PBR rendering, Shadows, Skybox, Kernel effects, Post Processing effects, Basic and Advanced Lighting and other interesting implementation along with ton of shaders ready to use.

#### Check the [forward_plus_renderer](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/OpenGL-Abstractions/blob/forward_plus_renderer/tests/AdvancedGL/compute/ForwardPlusRenderer.h) Branch to see the implementation of Forward Plus Tiled rendering example using SSBOs and Compute shaders in OpenGL
